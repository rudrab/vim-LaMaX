# vim-LaMaX
## DON'T download it now

This is a shameless copy of [vimtex by
lervag]( https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/blob/master/compiler/textidote.vim ), with his help in [vi
StackExchange]( https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/26188/text-to-vim-quickfix-with-navigation).

This github repo is currently unusable (even by me), and I am trying to make it work.
